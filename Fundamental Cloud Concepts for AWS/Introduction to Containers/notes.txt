A container is a standardized unit of software. 

Containers run over a Containerized Platform and shares the Operating System's kernel enabling to create 
container images using file system layers. Because Containers isolates softwares from the other layers, the
code runs identically across different environments. 

Benefits of Dockers include:
    - Portable runtime application environment
    - Package application and dependencies in a single, immutable artifacts
    - Ability to run different application versions with different dependencies simlutaneously
    - Faster development and deployment cycles
    - Better resource utilization and efficiency

Characteristics of Microservices:
    - Decentralized, evolutionary design
    - Smart Endpoints, dumb pipes
    - Independent Products, not projects 
    - Designed for failure
    - Disposability
    - Development and Production Parity
